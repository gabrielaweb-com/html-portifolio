<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Gabriela, I am currently 18 and studying Web Development, I am origially from Brazil but I have been living in Portugal for over 6 years, I moved here when I was pretty young and the thing I miss the most about my home country is definetly my family. I'm planning on going there to visit soon so that makes me extremely excited and hopefull.  </p>

<p>Getting into this study path has been a ride for me. Because I got into university so young (I was 17 and most of my colleagues were 19 plus) I didn't have the mentality neccessary for the eexperience of a whole new reality and habits, and that made me very lost for a while. After analising all the options of courses I could study and ways that I could do that, I chose to get out of the university I was in and pursue this online course, and let me be honest, I have never been more certain that this was the path I should've taken and I'm glad this is my goal now.</p>

<p>I hope this small introduction about me was enough for you to understand my trajectory to where I am right now. </p>
